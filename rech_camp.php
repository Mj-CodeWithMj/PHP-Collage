                              The Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India established AERC at Vallabh Vidyanagar as an associated institution of M-J University in 1961. The Centre is fully funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, and it operates under the administrative controller of Vice-Chancellor. This is one of the 15 AERC Centres/Units established by the Government of India. The centre has been functioning in close collaboration with the Department of Economics, M-J University ever since its inception. One of the senior members of the faculty in the Department of Economics guides and supervises its activities as its Honorary Director. This association has been mutually beneficial to the Centre and the Department, with the result that it has helped the Department strengthen its teaching and research in Economics substantially. The Centre has by now completed 159 problem-oriented studies, 21 village surveys and 4 village resurveys. Most of these research projects have been taken up by Centre on the recommendation of the Government of India and State Governments of Gujarat and Rajasthan.
                            </strong>

The Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India has also assigned to the AERC and the Department of Economics, M-J University a Cell called the Cost of Cultivation of Principal Crops (CCS) in 1970.
